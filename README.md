## Experimental encoder-decoder
Inspired from Huffman coding which is a lossless data compression algorithm.I have derived another algorithm in which the idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code.

**Notes**
Applications of Encoding-Decoding:
1. They are used for transmitting fax and text.    
2. They are used by conventional compression formats like PKZIP, GZIP, etc.    
3. It is useful in cases where there is a series of frequently occurring characters.
